When using a graphical user interface, we need another program called a terminal emulator to interact(交互） with the shell. If we look through our desktop（桌>面） menus, we will probably find one. KDE uses konsole（终端程序） and GNOME uses gnome-terminal, though it’s likely called simply “terminal” on our menu. There are a number of other terminal emulators available for Linux, but they all basically do the same thing; give us access to the shell. You will probably develop a preference（偏爱） for one or another based on the number of bells and whistles（花俏） it has.2
